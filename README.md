### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer in training with experience in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL, & Node.js.
          
After working in Digital Marketing for over 8 years, I was just sick of working with (and using) bad websites with terrible UX and clunky code. So I decided I needed to learn how to fix this! 

I have only just started my journey to becoming a Software Developer and, to be honest, I really didn't think I would love coding so much! I just wish I didn't dream so much about solving JavaScript algorithms.

I'm interested in making websites that aren't ageist and ableist - tech made for every human and something my daughter will be proud of one day. 

What's your favourite language? Or do you have a a challenge for me? Hit me up at lily@lilyso.net. I love to fix things.
