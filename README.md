### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

After working in Digital Marketing for over 8 years, I was just sick of working with (and using) bad websites with terrible UX and clunky code. So I decided I needed to learn how to fix this! 

I'm currently on my journey to becoming a Full Stack Developer and I'm interested in making websites that aren't ageist and ableist - tech made for every human and something my daughter will be proud of one day. 

My Mantra:

AS a CONSUMER,
I WANT a WEBSITE/APP that fits SEAMLESSLY into my life and adds VALUE either through EXPERIENCE or meeting my needs EFFICIENTLY
SO I can have MORE TIME to do the things I LOVE.

What's your mantra and favourite language? Or do you have a a challenge for me? Hit me up at lily@lilyso.net. I love to fix things.
